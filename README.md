# CS50AI
# A collection of AI projects I've made

Welcome to the CS50AI Projects repository! This collection showcases various artificial intelligence projects developed as part of the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course. Each project explores different AI concepts and algorithms, providing practical implementations and insights.

## Projects Included

1. **Attention**: A machine learning project that implements attention mechanisms to enhance model focus on relevant data during processing.

2. **Pagerank**: A project that explores the PageRank algorithm, used by search engines to rank web pages based on their importance.

3. **Parser**: A natural language processing project that parses sentences and extracts grammatical structures.

4. **Traffic**: An AI that simulates traffic flow and optimizes traffic light timings.

## Getting Started
