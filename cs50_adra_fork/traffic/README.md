# Traffic Sign Classifier

This project is a Python script that trains a neural network to classify images of traffic signs. It leverages TensorFlow for model training and OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess images of traffic signs for training.
- **Neural Network Model**: Define and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signs.
- **Model Evaluation and Saving**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data and save the trained model to a file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
